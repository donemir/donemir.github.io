I’ve worked in different positions with different responsibilities and I tried to make some good changes in all places I have
been. I’m a web designer and developer with more than 7 years of experience. I’ve made different web apps with different
technologies such as PHP on Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Angular, React, Ionic, and also used WordPress as my lower-cost
solutions many times. However, I’m still learning and trying to know more about technologies and methods. I am good at
search, problem-finding, and problem-solving. Finding and developing new efficient solutions is my favorite job.
